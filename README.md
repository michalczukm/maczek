# üêï Maczek's Feeding Tracker

A beautifully designed, printable dog feeding calendar that helps me track Maczek's daily feeding schedule. This app displays a 2-week calendar view starting from Monday, with interactive checkboxes for each meal time and space for notes about special treats or behavior observations.

The calendar can be printed on A4 paper and stuck on the fridge for easy reference. The QR code links to its URL - so you can easily access it from your phone when printed.

This project was fully vibecoded.
