# 🐕 Maczek's Feeding Tracker

A beautifully designed, printable dog feeding calendar that helps you track your dog's daily feeding schedule. This app displays a 2-week calendar view starting from Monday, with interactive checkboxes for each meal time and space for notes about special treats or behavior observations.

Perfect for busy dog owners who want to ensure their furry friend gets fed on time, the calendar can be printed on A4 paper and stuck on the fridge for easy reference. The app includes a QR code that links back to the digital version for quick access.

This project was fully vibecoded with love for Maczek! 🐾
